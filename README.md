This is a template I use for creating new projects based in Django 1.5.1.  Based heavily on [Daniel Greenfield](https://github.com/pydanny/) and [Audrey Roy](https://github.com/audreyr)'s setups and their excellent book [Two Scoops of Django](https://django.2scoops.org/).  

I basically forked Audrey Roy's [django-handstand-audreyr](https://github.com/audreyr/django-handstand-audreyr) and updated it to use Django 1.5.1 and all of the most recent versions of its core django-modules.  I also updated and improved upon the templates.  In form with modular application design, I separated out _navigation.html and _footer.html from the site base.  Replaced the previous bootstap template with a responsive base design.

Please see [requirements.txt](https://github.com/iepathos/handstand-django151-iepathos/blob/master/handstand-django151-iepathos/requirements/requirements.txt) for a list of included base Python packages.

Feel free to copy and modify my starter project to suit your needs.
